# Challenge - Sorting Challenge (Java)

## Steps:
- Using __/sort/App.java__ update the file to complete the sort (only edit the one method called __Sort__).
- If you wish you can create additional new methods but do not edit the main or Validate methods.
- If the method has been updated correctly then it will print a message of "...Success" on the screen.

__Good luck and happy coding!__
